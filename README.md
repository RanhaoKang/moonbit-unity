# MoonBit-Unity

A very handy framework that lets you write MoonBit in Unity. (MoonBit -> JS backend -> PuerTS -> Unity)

"Handy" means few magic in gluing things together. Since MoonBit is rapidly growing in both language features and toolchains, I want to keep things bare and easy to evolve together.

Though still primitive, you can now begin exploring MoonBit in Unity.

# Get started
Tested with Unity 6 (6000.0.38f1) and Moon's version as below.
```bash
moon 0.1.20250402 (5cc5674 2025-04-02) ~/.moon/bin/moon
moonc v0.1.20250402+bf7b62354 ~/.moon/bin/moonc
moonrun 0.1.20250402 (5cc5674 2025-04-02) ~/.moon/bin/moonrun
```

Open `Assets/MoonBit/Samples/RotateCube.unity` and enter Play mode.

**TEMP** Run `python3 build.py` to compile code, see `todos` in it.
